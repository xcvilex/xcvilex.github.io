      <h3>When You Realize You’ve Been Abandoning Yourself Longer Than Anyone Else Has</h3>
      <p>You ever sit down and realize the longest, most consistent ghosting situation you’ve ever been in… is with yourself?</p>
      <p>I used to think I had abandonment issues because of other people. Turns out, I just got really good at pre-abandoning myself so no one else had to bother.</p>
      <p>I didn’t speak up. Didn’t rest. Didn’t ask for help. Didn’t say “ouch” when it hurt.</p>
      <p>Now I’m learning how to stay. With me. Even when I’m needy. Even when I disappoint myself.</p>
      <p>That’s what healing looks like. Sometimes it’s just not leaving the room when your own heart is breaking.</p>
